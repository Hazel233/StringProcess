```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Use the following chunk to set up the `funfurther` package.

```{r setup}
library(funfurther)
```

You can use this improved function to do some things which cannot be done by the 
old one!

```{r}
x <- c("3D/MON&SUN")
strsplit(x, "[/&]", type = "before")
```
